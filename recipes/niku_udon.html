        <li>Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces. (If you can’t get thinly sliced beef,  get yourself some steak and freeze for about 30 minutes. When it’s partially frozen, it will be a lot easier to slice.)</li>
        <li>Make the sauce for beef. In a small container, mix together the soy sauce, sugar, mirin, and ginger. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pot, mix together 4 cups (960ml) of water along with the soy sauce, mirin, and Hondashi. Bring it to a boil. Once it starts boiling and bubbling, turn the heat off. Taste and add more salt if it’s needed. Cover and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat the oil (1 tbsp) over medium-high heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the beef and onion. Stir-fry for 2 minutes or until the beef is no longer pink. Pour in the sauce. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the beef is cooked through. Turn the heat off and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Ladle some water out into your bowls. Once the bowls are heated, dump the water out.</li>
        <li>Divide the drained noodles into serving bowls. Gently add some broth over the noodles. Top with beef, fish cake (if using), Soft-Boiled Egg, and green onions. Enjoy~!</li>
