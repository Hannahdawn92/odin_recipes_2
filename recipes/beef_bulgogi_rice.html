    <h2>Beef Bulgogi and Mushroom Rice is one of my favorite Korean-style one-pot dishes. If you’re a big fan of Korean BBQ beef and mushrooms, this is the one to make. Juicy, tender beef with super flavorful mushrooms—trust me, once you take a bite, it will just become your new favorite weeknight dinner.</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>2 cups (standard measuring cup) uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups (480ml) water</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder (or Korean beef stock powder)1/2 tbsp chicken bouillon powder (or Korean beef stock powder)</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 lb (450g) thinly sliced beef</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>5 green onions, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion</li>
        <li>4-5 shiitake mushrooms, about 3.5 oz (100g) in total</li>
        <li>5 button mushrooms, about 3.5 oz (100g) in total</li>
        <li>3 tbsp neutral-tasting oil, divided</li>
        <li>A pat of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp neutral oil (such as grape seed, canola, vegetable oil, etc.)</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Prepare the rice: Rinse the rice a few times to remove any dust or debris. Drain and soak in cold water for 30 minutes. (Unlike using a rice cooker, you really need to do this step beforehand. Otherwise, the rice can be undercooked.)</li>
        <li>Season the water for the rice: In a container, combine 2 cups of water with the chicken bouillon powder and soy sauce. Mix well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Marinate the beef:  Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces and place it in a mixing bowl. Add all the marinade ingredients and gently massage to coat evenly. Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Prepare the vegetables: Finely chop the garlic cloves. Thinly slice the green onions, separating the whites and greens. Finely dice the onion. Thinly slice the shiitake mushrooms and quarter the button mushrooms.</li>
        <li>In a large nonstick pot, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat. Once it gets nice and hot, place the marinated beef in a single layer and sear for 1 to 2 minutes or until the bottom turns golden brown. Flip and stir-fry for another 2 minutes. Remove the beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Once it’s heated, add the garlic, onion, and white parts of the green onions. Sauté for 1 minute or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for 3 minutes. Add the drained rice and gently stir-fry it for 1 minute, making sure every single grain is coated with the aromatic oil.</li>
        <li>Pour in the seasoned water and bring it to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Once the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low. Place the cooked beef over the rice and cover with a lid. Simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, but keep the lid on. Let it steam for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the green parts of the green onions and a pat of butter. Gently fluff the rice and mix everything together. Serve with kimchi. Enjoy!</li>
