    <h2>Korean marinated eggs, also known as mayak eggs, are soft-boiled eggs soaked in a delicious marinade made with soy sauce and aromatic vegetables. These eggs are soft, jammy, and so flavorful that they’ve even earned the nickname “drug eggs” for their addictive taste! So, today, let’s find out together how addictive they really are.</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>1/4 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 Cheongyang chili pepper (or serrano, jalapeno, etc.) (optional)</li>
        <li>1 mild red chili (or red bell pepper)</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>Hot steamed rice, about 1 cup (210g) for each serving</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Finely chop the onion and chili peppers. (You can reduce the amount of chili peppers since their spice level can vary.) Thinly slice the green onions. Finely chop the garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the soy sauce, water, sugar, vinegar, sesame seeds, sesame oil, and black pepper. Mix well. Add all the prepared vegetables to the marinade. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Fill a pot with 6 cups of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and gently add 6 large eggs. Stir gently to keep the yolks centered, or give them a little shake before cooking. This helps ensure the yolks are perfectly centered. Cook for 7 minutes for soft-boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Transfer the eggs to an ice bath to cool completely. Peel the eggs once they’re cooled. (If you want to make a larger batch, you can prepare up to 10 eggs using this method.)</li>
        <li>Add the peeled eggs to the marinade and gently stir to coat them. Make sure the eggs are fully submerged. If not, give them a gentle stir halfway through the marinating time to ensure even flavoring. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>To serve, scoop the egg(s) from the marinade and place them over hot steamed rice. Drizzle with extra marinade and a touch of sesame oil. Enjoy!
